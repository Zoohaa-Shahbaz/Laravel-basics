# Day 02 – Named Routes, Redirects & Route Groups

## ✅ What I Practiced Today:

- **Named Routes** using `->name()` to simplify route access from Blade.
- **Redirects** with `Route::redirect()` and HTTP status codes:
  - `301` = Permanent (SEO-friendly redirect)
  - `302` = Temporary (default)
- **Route Groups** using `Route::prefix()` to group related routes under a common URL.

- # Day 03 – Blade Template Basics

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Displaying data with `{{ }}` and `{!! !!}`
- Blade comments and escaping `@`
- PHP code in `@php` blocks
