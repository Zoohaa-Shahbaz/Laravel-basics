# Day 02 â€“ Named Routes, Redirects & Route Groups

## âœ… What I Practiced Today:

- **Named Routes** using `->name()` to simplify route access from Blade.
- **Redirects** with `Route::redirect()` and HTTP status codes:
  - `301` = Permanent (SEO-friendly redirect)
  - `302` = Temporary (default)
- **Route Groups** using `Route::prefix()` to group related routes under a common URL.

- # Day 03 â€“ Blade Template Basics

## âœ… Topics Covered:
- Displaying data with `{{ }}` and `{!! !!}`
- Blade comments and escaping `@`
- PHP code in `@php` blocks
- Loops with `@foreach` and `$loop`:
  - `index`, `first`, `last`

## âœ… Topics Practiced:

- `@include('view')` â€“ Include a Blade view normally.
- `@include('view', [...])` â€“ Pass data to included view.
- `@includeIf('view')` â€“ Include only if the view exists.

- `@includeUnless(condition, 'view')` â€“ Include if condition is false.

```php
$books = ["one" => "Apple", "two" => "Banana", "three" => "Orange"];
